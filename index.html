<p> Since 2014 the United States has seen a steady increase in the number of deaths from Alzheimers disease. The brain disorder gradually destroys the memory of the victim while at different rates depending on its severity, hampering an individuals ability to recall core memories, retain motor skills or even communicate effectively. </p> 

<p> According to data from the CDC, Mississippi is the state with the highest death rate per 100,000 with 48.5 deaths for every 100,000 people. The state with the lowest death rate per 100,000 people is New York with 11.7 deaths. </p>

After further analysis of total deaths there was a sharp increase in deaths from Alzheimers in 2020 coinciding with the COVID-19 pandemic before petering off then continuing to steadily grow since 2021. </p>

In 2020 the majority of the victims of the pandemic were older Americans. During the pandemic many statistics conflated deaths from the disease with deaths from Alzheimers, it is possible that many Alzheimers victims died from COVID-19 directly rather than from the brain disorder. This is an interesting caveat in data collection from the pandemic that has seemingly left a confusing ripple in collection. </p>

</script>

More worrying though is the general increase in deaths from Alzheimers amongst Americans. There is no cure for the disease however preventative measures like playing brain games, reading, or learning a second language are preventative measures for those at risk. </p>
